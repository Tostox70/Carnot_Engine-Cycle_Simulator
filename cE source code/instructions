- It is advised to use VS Code to run the files, since the process with other IDEs are unknown (to me)
- Install .NET Install tool and C# extensions
- Create an empty folder and open it in VS Code
- Open VS Code built-in Terminal and paste 
dotnet new console
- Two files should be created, one named Program.cs and yourFolderName.csproj
- Open VS Code built-in Terminal again and paste 
dotnet add package Raylib-cs
-If the download is successful, you can copy-paste the files and run them

Note: The same process works for Mac
