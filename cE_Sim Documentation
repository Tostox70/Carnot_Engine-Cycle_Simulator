1. Formulas

1.1 Gas Volume

Volumes for the Carnot cycle stages:
	•	Stage 1: V1 = 0.01 m^3
	•	Stage 2: V2 = 2 * V1
	•	Stage 3: V3 = V2 * (TH / TC)^(1 / gamma)
	•	Stage 4: V4 = V1 * (TH / TC)^(1 / gamma)

Where:
	•	TH = Hot reservoir temperature
	•	TC = Cold reservoir temperature
	•	gamma = Heat capacity ratio (5/3 for monoatomic, 7/5 diatomic, 4/3 triatomic gases)

⸻

1.2 Pressure

Calculated using the ideal gas law:

P = n * R * T / V

Where:
	•	n = Number of moles
	•	R = 8.314 J/mol·K
	•	T = Temperature in Kelvin
	•	V = Volume

⸻

1.3 Heat Transfer
	•	Heat absorbed: QH = n * R * TH * ln(V2 / V1)
	•	Heat released: QC = n * R * TC * ln(V4 / V3)

⸻

1.4 Work Done
	•	Work by the gas: Wgas = QH + W2, where W2 = n * R / gamma * (TH - TC)
	•	Work by surroundings: Wsurr = QC + W4, where W4 = n * R / gamma * (TC - TH)

⸻

1.5 Efficiency

Carnot efficiency: eta(n) = Wtot / QH * 100, where Wtot = |QH| - |QC|

2. Step Integration Methods

2.1 Time-Based Integration

The simulation uses time-based step integration to calculate the state of the system at each stage of the Carnot cycle. 
The method divides the cycle into discrete steps based on the target FPS and time per stage.

Step size: deltaT = timePerStage / frameRate

Where:
	•	timePerStage = Duration of each stage in seconds (fixed to 2sec)
	•	frameRate = Target frames per second (fixed to 60fps)

⸻

2.2 Stage-Based Integration

Four stages of the Carnot cycle:
	1.	Isothermal Expansion – Heat absorbed, gas expands at constant temperature
	2.	Adiabatic Expansion – Gas expands without heat exchange; temperature decreases
	3.	Isothermal Compression – Heat released, gas compresses at constant temperature
	4.	Adiabatic Compression – Gas compresses without heat exchange; temperature increases

	•	Step size dynamically adjusted based on stage and duration

⸻

2.3 Dynamic Updates
	•	User inputs: adjust temperature, number of moles, and gamma
	•	Graphs: update PV and TS curves at each step
	•	Visuals: graphical elements updated based on current state
