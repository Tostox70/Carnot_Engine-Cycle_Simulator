# Carnot_Engine-Cycle_Simulator
A real-time Carnot engine simulator that visualizes the full cycle with PV and TS diagrams, a moving piston animation, and calculated outputs like efficiency and work. Designed for students and physics enthusiasts who want an intuitive way to explore thermodynamics.

**YOU CAN DOWNLOAD IT (WINDOWS)
[HERE](https://github.com/Tostox70/Carnot_Engine-Cycle_Simulator/releases/download/v1.0/cE_Sim.zip)**


**YOU CAN DOWNLOAD IT (MacOS)
[HERE](https://github.com/Tostox70/Carnot_Engine-Cycle_Simulator/releases/download/v1.0.Mac/cE_macOS.zip)**

(Full code is under the cE folder)

<br><br>
**FOR MAC USERS**

macOS may block the app with a message saying it is damaged.
This is expected for unsigned apps.

Instructions:

1-Open Terminal

2-If the app is in your Downloads folder, run:

xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/cE.app

3-You can now open cE.app normally (double-click)

**FEATURES** (v1.0)

-Real-time PV and TS graphs

-Animated piston following the Carnot cycle

-Adjustable parameters:

-Hot and cold reservoir temperatures

-Number of moles

-Heat capacity ratio (γ)

-Realistic (not guaranteed perfect) calculations like total work and thermal efficiency

-Clear UI that reacts to user input  


**HOW TO USE**

-Hover over any parameter box (temperature, moles, γ).

-The value turns gray.

-Press Right / Up arrow to increase the value.

-Press Left / Down arrow to decrease it.

-The PV/TS graphs and piston update in real time.


**TECH STACK**

-C# (.NET)

-Raylib (raylib-cs)


**FUTURE DEVELOPMENT**

-More features are planned. Your feedback and requests will guide what comes next.
